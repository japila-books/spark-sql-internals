== [[InputPartitionReader]] InputPartitionReader Contract

`InputPartitionReader` is the <<contract, abstraction>> of <<implementations, input partition readers>> in <<spark-sql-data-source-api-v2.adoc#, Data Source API V2>> that can <<next, proceed to the next record>> and <<get, get the current record>>.

`InputPartitionReader` is also a Java https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Closeable.html[Closeable].

`InputPartitionReader` is associated with two other abstractions: <<spark-sql-InputPartition.adoc#, InputPartition>> and `ContinuousInputPartition` that are responsible for creating <<implementations, concrete InputPartitionReaders>>.

NOTE: It _appears_ that all concrete <<implementations, input partition readers>> are used in Spark Structured Streaming only.
