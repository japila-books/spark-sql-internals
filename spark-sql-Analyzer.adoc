== [[Analyzer]] Analyzer -- Logical Query Plan Analyzer

`Analyzer` (aka _Spark Analyzer_ or _Query Analyzer_) is the *logical query plan analyzer* that <<execute, semantically validates and transforms an unresolved logical plan>> to an *analyzed logical plan*.

`Analyzer` is a concrete <<spark-sql-catalyst-RuleExecutor.adoc#, RuleExecutor>> of <<spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc#, LogicalPlan>> (i.e. `RuleExecutor[LogicalPlan]`) with the <<batches, logical evaluation rules>>.

```
Analyzer: Unresolved Logical Plan ==> Analyzed Logical Plan
```

`Analyzer` uses <<catalog, SessionCatalog>> while resolving relational entities, e.g. databases, tables, columns.

`Analyzer` is <<creating-instance, created>> when `SessionState` is requested for the <<spark-sql-SessionState.adoc#analyzer, analyzer>>.

`Analyzer` is available as the <<spark-sql-SessionState.adoc#analyzer, analyzer>> property of a session-specific `SessionState`.

[source, scala]
----
scala> :type spark
org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

scala> :type spark.sessionState.analyzer
org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer
----

You can access the analyzed logical plan of a structured query (as a <<spark-sql-Dataset.adoc#, Dataset>>) using <<spark-sql-dataset-operators.adoc#explain, Dataset.explain>> basic action (with `extended` flag enabled) or SQL's `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` SQL command.

[source, scala]
----
// sample structured query
val inventory = spark
  .range(5)
  .withColumn("new_column", 'id + 5 as "plus5")

// Using explain operator (with extended flag enabled)
scala> inventory.explain(extended = true)
== Parsed Logical Plan ==
'Project [id#0L, ('id + 5) AS plus5#2 AS new_column#3]
+- AnalysisBarrier
      +- Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=Some(8))

== Analyzed Logical Plan ==
id: bigint, new_column: bigint
Project [id#0L, (id#0L + cast(5 as bigint)) AS new_column#3L]
+- Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=Some(8))

== Optimized Logical Plan ==
Project [id#0L, (id#0L + 5) AS new_column#3L]
+- Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=Some(8))

== Physical Plan ==
*(1) Project [id#0L, (id#0L + 5) AS new_column#3L]
+- *(1) Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=8)
----

Alternatively, you can access the analyzed logical plan using `QueryExecution` and its <<spark-sql-QueryExecution.adoc#analyzed, analyzed>> property  (that together with `numberedTreeString` method is a very good "debugging" tool).

[source, scala]
----
val analyzedPlan = inventory.queryExecution.analyzed
scala> println(analyzedPlan.numberedTreeString)
00 Project [id#0L, (id#0L + cast(5 as bigint)) AS new_column#3L]
01 +- Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=Some(8))
----

`Analyzer` defines <<extendedResolutionRules, extendedResolutionRules>> extension point for additional logical evaluation rules that a custom `Analyzer` can use to extend the <<Resolution, Resolution>> rule batch. The rules are added at the end of the `Resolution` batch.

NOTE: link:spark-sql-SessionState.adoc[SessionState] uses its own `Analyzer` with custom <<extendedResolutionRules, extendedResolutionRules>>, <<postHocResolutionRules, postHocResolutionRules>>, and <<extendedCheckRules, extendedCheckRules>> extension methods.

[[internal-registries]]

[cols="1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Name
| Description

| [[extendedResolutionRules]] `extendedResolutionRules`
| Additional link:spark-sql-catalyst-Rule.adoc[rules] for <<Resolution, Resolution>> batch.

Empty by default

| [[fixedPoint]] `fixedPoint`
| `FixedPoint` with <<maxIterations, maxIterations>> for <<Hints, Hints>>, <<Substitution, Substitution>>, <<Resolution, Resolution>> and <<Cleanup, Cleanup>> batches.

Set when `Analyzer` <<creating-instance, is created>> (and can be defined explicitly or through link:spark-sql-CatalystConf.adoc#optimizerMaxIterations[optimizerMaxIterations] configuration setting.

| [[postHocResolutionRules]] `postHocResolutionRules`
| The only link:spark-sql-catalyst-Rule.adoc[rules] in <<Post-Hoc-Resolution, Post-Hoc Resolution>> batch if defined (that are executed in one pass, i.e. `Once` strategy). Empty by default
|===

`Analyzer` is used by `QueryExecution` to link:spark-sql-QueryExecution.adoc#analyzed[resolve the managed `LogicalPlan`] (and, as a sort of follow-up, link:spark-sql-QueryExecution.adoc#assertAnalyzed[assert that a structured query has already been properly analyzed], i.e. no failed or unresolved or somehow broken logical plan operators and expressions exist).

[[logging]]
[TIP]
====
Enable `TRACE` or `DEBUG` logging levels for the respective session-specific loggers to see what happens inside `Analyzer`.

* `pass:[org.apache.spark.sql.internal.SessionState$$anon$1]`

* `pass:[org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveSessionStateBuilder$$anon$1]` when link:spark-sql-SparkSession.adoc#enableHiveSupport[Hive support is enabled]

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
# with no Hive support
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.sql.internal.SessionState$$anon$1=TRACE

# with Hive support enabled
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveSessionStateBuilder$$anon$1=DEBUG
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].

---

The reason for such weird-looking logger names is that `analyzer` attribute is created as an anonymous subclass of `Analyzer` class in the respective `SessionStates`.

=== [[execute]] Executing Logical Evaluation Rules -- `execute` Method

`Analyzer` is a link:spark-sql-catalyst-RuleExecutor.adoc[RuleExecutor] that defines the <<batches, logical rules>> (i.e. resolving, removing, and in general modifying it), e.g.

* Resolves unresolved <<ResolveRelations, relations>> and <<ResolveFunctions, functions>> (including link:spark-sql-Expression-UnresolvedGenerator.adoc[UnresolvedGenerators]) using provided <<catalog, SessionCatalog>>
* ...

Expects that all children of a logical operator are already resolved (and given it belongs to a fixed-point batch it will likely happen at some iteration).

Fails analysis when `grouping__id` Hive function is used.

```
scala> sql("select grouping__id").queryExecution.analyzed

TIP: Consult the https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L116-L167[sources of `Analyzer`] for the up-to-date list of the evaluation rules.

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating Analyzer Instance

`Analyzer` takes the following when created:

* [[catalog]] link:spark-sql-SessionCatalog.adoc[SessionCatalog]
* [[conf]] link:spark-sql-CatalystConf.adoc[CatalystConf]
* [[maxIterations]] Maximum number of iterations (of the <<fixedPoint, FixedPoint>> rule batches, i.e. <<Hints, Hints>>, <<Substitution, Substitution>>, <<Resolution, Resolution>> and <<Cleanup, Cleanup>>)

`Analyzer` initializes the <<internal-registries, internal registries and counters>>.

NOTE: `Analyzer` can also be created without specifying the <<maxIterations, maxIterations>> argument which is then configured using link:spark-sql-CatalystConf.adoc#optimizerMaxIterations[optimizerMaxIterations] configuration setting.

=== [[resolver]] `resolver` Method

[source, scala]
----
resolver: Resolver
----

`resolver` requests <<conf, CatalystConf>> for link:spark-sql-CatalystConf.adoc#resolver[Resolver].

NOTE: `Resolver` is a mere function of two `String` parameters that returns `true` if both refer to the same entity (i.e. for case insensitive equality).

=== [[resolveExpression]] `resolveExpression` Method

[source, scala]
----
resolveExpression(
  expr: Expression,
  plan: LogicalPlan,
  throws: Boolean = false): Expression

=== [[executeAndCheck]] `executeAndCheck` Method
