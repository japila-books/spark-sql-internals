`TableScan` is the <<contract, contract>> of <<implementations, BaseRelations>> with support for <<buildScan, column pruning>>, i.e. can eliminate unneeded columns before producing an RDD containing all of its tuples as `Row` objects.

| [[buildScan]] Building distributed data scan with column pruning

In other words, `buildScan` creates a `RDD[Row]` to represent a distributed data scan (i.e. scanning over data in a relation).

Used exclusively when `DataSourceStrategy` execution planning strategy is requested to link:spark-sql-SparkStrategy-DataSourceStrategy.adoc#TableScan[plan a LogicalRelation with a TableScan].

[[implementations]]
NOTE: <<spark-sql-KafkaRelation.adoc#, KafkaRelation>> is the one and only known implementation of the <<contract, TableScan Contract>> in Spark SQL.
