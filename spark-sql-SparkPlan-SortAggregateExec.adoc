=== [[doExecute]] Executing Physical Operator (Generating RDD[InternalRow]) -- `doExecute` Method

[source, scala]
----
doExecute(): RDD[InternalRow]
----

NOTE: `doExecute` is part of <<spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc#doExecute, SparkPlan Contract>> to generate the runtime representation of a structured query as a distributed computation over <<spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc#, internal binary rows>> on Apache Spark (i.e. `RDD[InternalRow]`).

`doExecute`...FIXME
