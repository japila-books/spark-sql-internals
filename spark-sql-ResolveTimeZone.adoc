== [[ResolveSubquery]] ResolveSubquery Logical Resolution Rule

`ResolveTimeZone` is a logical resolution rule that the link:spark-sql-Analyzer.adoc#ResolveRelations[logical query plan analyzer] uses to <<apply, FIXME>>.

Technically, `ResolveTimeZone` is just a link:spark-sql-catalyst-Rule.adoc[Catalyst rule] for transforming link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical plans], i.e. `Rule[LogicalPlan]`.

`ResolveTimeZone` is part of link:spark-sql-Analyzer.adoc#Resolution[Resolution] fixed-point batch of rules.
