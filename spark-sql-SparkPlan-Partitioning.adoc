== [[Partitioning]] Partitioning -- Specification of Physical Operator's Output Partitions

`Partitioning` is the <<contract, contract>> to hint the Spark Physical Optimizer for the number of partitions the output of a <<spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc#, physical operator>> should be split across.

[[contract]]
[[numPartitions]]
[source, scala]

numPartitions: Int

`numPartitions` is used in:

* `EnsureRequirements` physical preparation rule to link:spark-sql-EnsureRequirements.adoc#ensureDistributionAndOrdering[enforce partition requirements of a physical operator]

* link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-SortMergeJoinExec.adoc[SortMergeJoinExec] for `outputPartitioning` for `FullOuter` join type
* `Partitioning.allCompatible`
